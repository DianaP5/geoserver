### <a name="intro"></a> 1. Introduction

#### <a name="context"></a> 1.1 Context

GeoServer is an open source java server that allows users to share, process and edit geospatial data. One of the more important aspects of the server is the integration with various geographic information systems in use today, which is done through open standards.

#### <a name="services"></a> 3.1 WFS, WCS and WMS

To allow sharing of data GeoServer implements the following widely used open standards for geospatial data:

*  [WFS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs) versions 1.0.0, 1.1.0 and 2.0.0 for vector data. This allows compliant systems acess to the data structures and source data.
  * The WFS implementation is integrated with the Security system to limit access.

* [WCS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wcs) versions 1.0, 1.1 and 2.0. They work similarly to WFS but for raster data.

* [WMS](http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms) versions 1.1.1, the most used, and 1.3.0. WMS provides a standard for geospatial map image requests, allowing clients to combine multiple images.
 * GeoServer also provides KML as a WMS output, allowing integration with for example, google earth.
